title: Sync HackMD with Github
---
In my realm, ci/cd pipelines and n-tier application server deployments can be complex. How cool is it to have an online markdown editor like [hackmd.io](https://hackmd.io/c/tutorials/%2Fs%2Flink-with-github) synched with github and published out to the web just like that. It may be an old hat for others, but for me it's revolutionary. ha! Blogging is fun without all the overhead :)
