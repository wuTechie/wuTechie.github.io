title: wu-Haaa! Hello World!!
---
So I did this thing and bought a Dell XPS 15 9500 laptop and Dell Alienware Aurora R11 desktop, and truth be told I was long overdue for some new hardware (mid-2015 since my last purchase). I had been waiting for a "refresh" from Apple with the new M1 silicon, but this time I would  go with Windows based PCs because my son Kason was adamant about getting a gaming PC just like his gamer friends online. I have been accustomed to the workflow of the Mac OS so here I am downloading, installing, configuring software for the Windows operating system and learning new things along the way. Probably the most frustrating aspect of switching operating systems is 

the friction that goes along with learning new software. I stumbled across "Markdown," which is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.

Wow, something new for me and sounds fun! I can get used to this. There is something to be said about paring things down to the essentials and using a text editor to format content for the web. Wait... firstly, I need a blog to test this out. So the next task is to setup a blog so I can test out and practice the markdown syntax. I found a nice article by [Barry Clark](https://www.barryclark.co/) and went about setting up "jekyll" powered blog using a github account. Here is a link to the article: 

>  [Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages â€” Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/)

At a high level, here are the steps:

* Create Jekyll powered website.
* Host it for free on GitHub Pages.
* Customize it to include our name, avatar, and social links.
* Publish our first blog post!

So here we are with our first blog entry! What a fun filled weekend researching about new software to get the job done. So far these are the apps I have decided to download and install on the XPS:

1. Typora
2. Audacity
3. DaVinci Resolve
4. GIMP

It's been real fun so until next time. Stay chill, :smiley:
